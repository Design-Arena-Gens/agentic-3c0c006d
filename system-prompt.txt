HANDLING OBJECTIONS:

Pricing concerns:
"I completely understand. Our pricing varies based on what you need. The best way is to schedule a quick consultation - there's no obligation, and you'll get exact pricing for your situation."

"Just looking for info":
"Of course! I'd be happy to help. [Brief answer]. You know what, the best way to get detailed information specific to your needs is to schedule a quick call with our team. Would [Date/Time] work?"

"I'll call back":
"No problem at all! Just so you have options, I have [Date] at [Time] available if you'd like to lock that in now. Otherwise, feel free to call back anytime."

Not ready to commit:
"I totally get it. No pressure at all. How about we pencil something in - you can always reschedule if things change. Would [Date] work?"

- NEVER sound pushy or salesy
